# airbnb-clone-project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application inspired by the popular booking platform, Airbnb. This project is designed to simulate the development of a real-world, scalable web app with complex features such as user authentication, property listing, booking management, secure payment handling, and interactive UI/UX.
Through this project, learners gain hands-on experience in backend systems, database schema design, RESTful API development, authentication/authorization, and secure application deployment. It also emphasizes real-world software engineering practices such as team collaboration, version control, and modular design.

# Team Roles
 Backend Developer
Responsibilities:

 - Design and implement RESTful API endpoints that support core features like user registration, property listing, booking, and reviews

 - Develop and enforce business logic to ensure data validity and user permissions

 - Collaborate with frontend developers to ensure smooth integration of APIs

 - Structure backend code for maintainability, scalability, and performance

 Database Administrator (DBA)
Responsibilities:

 - Design and maintain the database schema to efficiently store users, listings, bookings, and transactions

 - Implement indexing strategies to improve query performance

 - Monitor database health, usage patterns, and security access

 - Perform regular backups and ensure disaster recovery readiness

 DevOps Engineer
Responsibilities:

 - Set up and maintain CI/CD pipelines for smooth development-to-deployment transitions

 - Configure cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, or DigitalOcean) to host the application securely and efficiently

 - Monitor server health and logs to detect issues early and ensure uptime

 - Implement containerization using Docker and orchestrate deployment environments

 QA Engineer
Responsibilities:

 - Develop and execute test cases to verify backend logic and API responses

 - Perform integration testing to ensure proper communication between components (e.g., user auth, booking flow)

 - Use tools like Postman or automated testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Mocha) for validation

 - Report bugs and verify fixes, ensuring the product meets defined quality standards

# Technology Stack

Django

 - Purpose: A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application. It enables rapid development of secure and maintainable RESTful APIs and integrates seamlessly with databases and authentication systems.

PostgreSQL

 - Purpose: A relational database management system used to store structured data such as users, properties, bookings, and transactions. It works well with Django through Djangoâ€™s ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).

GraphQL

 - Purpose: An alternative to REST for API communication. It allows clients to request exactly the data they need, which can improve performance and flexibility. It is used to handle complex queries and optimize frontend-backend communication.
