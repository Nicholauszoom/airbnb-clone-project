# airbnb-clone-project
The Airbnb Clone Project is a full-stack web application inspired by the popular booking platform, Airbnb. This project is designed to simulate the development of a real-world, scalable web app with complex features such as user authentication, property listing, booking management, secure payment handling, and interactive UI/UX.
Through this project, learners gain hands-on experience in backend systems, database schema design, RESTful API development, authentication/authorization, and secure application deployment. It also emphasizes real-world software engineering practices such as team collaboration, version control, and modular design.

# Backend Developer
Responsibilities:

Design and implement RESTful API endpoints that support core features like user registration, property listing, booking, and reviews

Develop and enforce business logic to ensure data validity and user permissions

Collaborate with frontend developers to ensure smooth integration of APIs

Structure backend code for maintainability, scalability, and performance

# Database Administrator (DBA)
Responsibilities:

Design and maintain the database schema to efficiently store users, listings, bookings, and transactions

Implement indexing strategies to improve query performance

Monitor database health, usage patterns, and security access

Perform regular backups and ensure disaster recovery readiness

# DevOps Engineer
Responsibilities:

Set up and maintain CI/CD pipelines for smooth development-to-deployment transitions

Configure cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, or DigitalOcean) to host the application securely and efficiently

Monitor server health and logs to detect issues early and ensure uptime

Implement containerization using Docker and orchestrate deployment environments

# QA Engineer
Responsibilities:

Develop and execute test cases to verify backend logic and API responses

Perform integration testing to ensure proper communication between components (e.g., user auth, booking flow)

Use tools like Postman or automated testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, Mocha) for validation

Report bugs and verify fixes, ensuring the product meets defined quality standards
